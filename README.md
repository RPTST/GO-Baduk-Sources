# GO-Baduk-Sources

My love of Go started with my Mathematics grad degree but had to give a break for some sad reasons for several years. Now I am back to this amazing game again thanks to an **_angel_** came into my dreams once! Here I share some sources to start with and famous games that I collect for myself which I think might be helpful to many others too! If you are already a Go player find me at OGS or KGS. Don't forget I am still training so be gentile please! :innocent:

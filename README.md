# GO-Baduk-Sources

My love of Go started with my Mathematics grad degree but had to give a break for some sad reasons for several years. The but now I am back to this amazing game thanks to an **_angel_** came into my dreams once! Here I share some sources to start with and famous games that I collect for myself which I think might be helpful to many others too! If you are already a Go player find me at OGS or KGS ;) Don't forget I am training too so be gentile please!
